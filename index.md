# Edmond Dantès

Edmond Dantès is an intelligent, honest and loving man who turns bitter and vengeful after he is framed for a crime he did not commit.
When Dantès finds himself free and enormously wealthy, he takes it upon himself to reward those who have helped him in his plight and punish those responsible for his years of suffering.
